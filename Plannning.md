# 1. Portfolio Purpose and Audience
## What is the purpose of this portfolio landing page?
The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my abilities and educational journey
through the various projects that I have completed. The page should create an impression of professionalism, curiosity and technical competence while remaining accessible to non technical viewers.

## Who is my target audience?
My primary audience includes my lecturers, classmates, potential mentors and potential future employers in the tech / AI fields. Knowing this affects my design choices because I must keep the layout professional. I will prioritize readability, structure, and logical organization over decorative design.

# 2. Content Planning
## What will I include on my landing page?

The header will include:

- My name: Abdul Mohaimin

- A short tagline such as: “Machine Learning Student | Aspiring AI Specialist”

- A short comment that best represents me

### Introduction section (Draft):
I am a Machine Learning student with a strong interest in quantitative analysis and data-driven problem solving. My work focuses on building models, understanding data patterns, and improving predictive accuracy. This portfolio showcases four key projects that demonstrate my learning progress and technical skills.

### Projects section:
will present the four projects using a card-based grid layout (2x2 on desktop, stacked vertically on mobile).

Each project card will include:

- Project title
- Short description (1–2 sentences)
- Key technologies used

# 3. Design Decisions 
## Colour Scheme 

Primary colour : Navy Blue #1B263B
Secondary colour : Light Gray #E0E1DD
Accent colour : Teal #00B4D8
Background colour : Off - white #F8F9FA
Text colour : Dark gray #212529

### Why did I choose these colours 

Navy Blue creates a professional and trustworthy impression and also aligns with my technological theme, the teal accent adds a modern, innovative feel without being overhelming. The light background and dark text provide strong contrast for readability.

### Typography 

Heading font : Poppins, sans serif 

Body text font : Open Sans, sans serif

Am I using web fonts -  Yes, from Google fonts 

Why did i choose these fonts? 

Poppins a modern and clean look for headings, making titles stand out clearly , open sans is highly readable for body texts and works well on screens. Together, they create a professional and structered visual hierarchy 

### Layout 

Overall structure: 
- single colums structure for main sections
- Grid Layout for projects
- Clear section spacing
- centered content container

Content Width:
- Max width: 1100px

Spacing: 
- Generous Padding (60px between sections)
- 20-30px padding inside cards
- consistent margin spacing

Why this layout approach?

This layout keeps the design clean and focused. The grid structure for projects organises information clearly while maintaining visual balance. Limiting content width improves readability on large screens. 

# 4. Navigation Structure 
### Navigation location 
Top right of header, horizontal layout. 

Links included:
1. Home → index.html
2. Neuron Project → neuron.html
3. Language Model → language.html
4. Prediction Model → prediction.html
5. Data Analysis → analysis.html

# 5. Wireframes 
## Desktop Wireframe:

layout structure: 
- Header (name + nav)

header Area : 

Name on the left, navigation on the right 

Main content area:
